			<h2>Personal Project</h2>
			
			<p>When I was in middle school, I became fascinated with the idea of creating my own video game.  I found a tool called Game Maker and began to tinker with it.  The program had a drag-and-drop interface for those with no programming experience, but every command had a "Game Maker Language" equivalent.  Once the user was comfortable, they could shift the project entirely to code.  It was this way that I inadvertently learned and become interested in programming.</p>
			
			<p>This game, built in Game Maker 8.0 (before it became Game Maker Studio!) has been a side project of mine ever since.  I started in middle school, and I've continued to add to it, refactor it, and apply what I've learned in my degree to improve it.  I've also learned many things about graphic design, animation, and level design as a result.  The game is still far from complete, but only because I continue to change and improve it as I develop my skills further.</p> <br />

				<p>This shows some basic running and jumping and a simple enemy.  All of the backgrounds/floors were also drawn by me using Adobe Flash.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay2.gif"><br />
				<p>The hammer can be used to attack enemies as well as break blocks.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay3.gif"><br />
				<p>Some '?' Blocks contain vines which can be climbed.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay4.gif"><br />
				<p>This is an early boss battle.  The player has to time his jumps in order to not get crushed, and the boss continues to use other moves and run faster as the battle progresses.  The boss was drawn and animated by me.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay5.gif"><br />
				<p>Badges can be found in hidden areas.  Equipping a badge can give you upgrades such as extra health, more attack power, or new moves.  Wearing a badge costs BP, or badge points.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay6.gif"><br />
				<p>This game is filled with puzzles that the player must solve in order to proceed.  Try to imagine how the player might proceed higher in the room after using the key to find the "hammer" item, which can break the yellow block in his way.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay7.gif"><br />
				<p>The player will join up with various characters throughout the game.  These characters will follow him around and provide a variety of additional abilities.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay8.gif"><br />
				<p>When enough enemies are defeated, the player levels up and can choose a stat to upgrade.  HP (Health Points) is health, FP (Flower Points) is used for special moves, and BP (Badge Boints) is used to equip badges.</p><br />

			<h2>Entrepreneurial Project: Even Heroes Die</h2>
			
			<p>For my Senior Capstone, I decided to join an entrepreneurial team in order to have the freedom to work on our own unique ideas.  As I have thoroughly enjoyed working on the above personal project, I  encouraged my team to design a game in order to explore my hobby further.  With two other programmers and two artists, we aimed to create a playable tech demo by the end of the semester.  This time, I would be using the much improved Game Maker Studio.</p>
			
			<p>Even Heroes Die is a 2D platforming video game in which the player starts off with a wide range of abilities, but slowly loses them over time due to a curse.  Before the curse sets in, the player player must trek across a vast kingdom and venture into procedurally generated dungeons, keeping track of what powers they have left in order to survive.</p>
			
			<div class="screenshots">
				<img src="gameplay2-1.gif"><br />
				<p>The game's overworld will be the same on each playthrough.  It will contain a wide variety of hidden secrets and challenges that will reward players for learning more about the game.  Players will have to make difficult decisions as they gamble precious time to pursue these secrets. The risk is high, but success can lead to helpful new abilities.</p><br />
				<img src="gameplay2-2.gif"><br />
				<p>Dungeons, on the other hand, have a different layout on each playthrough.  Above is a very simple dungeon.  In the future, these will be filled with enemies, traps, puzzles, and secrets.</p><br />
