					<h2>About Me</h2><br />
					
					
					
					
					<p>Hi!  I'm Kevyn Jaremko- a 22 year old, recent college graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Web and Information Systems.  I've created this site as a portfolio to showcase my experience and the projects I've worked on.  A big hobby of mine is game design, which is what originally fostered my interest in programming.</p>

					<p>When I was in middle school, I became fascinated with the idea of creating my own video game.  I had no programming experience, but I found a tool online called Game Maker. The program had a drag-and-drop interface to help non-programmers get started, but every command had a "Game Maker Language" equivalent. Once the user was comfortable, they could shift the project entirely to code. This is how I began to inadvertently learn some of the fundamentals of programming.</p>	

					<p>In high school, I took a Computer Science elective and found that I recognized a lot of the core concepts.  I enjoyed applying the knowledge I had gained on my own, and I soon fell in love with the problem-solving, puzzle-like nature of programming.  This is what ultimately led to my decision to major in Computer Science.</p>
